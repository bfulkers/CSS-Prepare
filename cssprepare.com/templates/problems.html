    <h1>Having problems?</h1>
    <p><i>CSS Prepare</i> should know about all of the properties defined in
      the <a href='http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/'>CSS 2.1 specification</a>.
      There are bound to be edge cases, however. If you find something you
      believe to be valid CSS but this complains, please report the
      problem (as described below).</p>
    
    <h2>Known problems</h2>
    <p>There are a few of the more esoteric parts of the CSS grammar that
      will trip <i>CSS Prepare</i> up. For example, being able to use newlines
      inside of selectors (see the last example in <a
      href='http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/syndata.html#rule-sets'>section
      4.1.7</a> of the specification). Whilst this may make <i>CSS Prepare</i>
      a <a
      href='http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/conform.html#conformance'>non-conforming
      user agent</a> because that means it fails on point 3. For me it is not
      as a high priority as supporting CSS3 properties that actually work in
      modern browsers.I have never seen anyone use it in the wild. But please,
      prove me wrong and I'll fix it.</p>
    <h3>CSS Hacks</h3>
    <p>There are a couple of common <a
      href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS_filter'>css hacks</a> (used to
      target earlier versions of Internet Explorer) that should work fine,
      including the <a
      href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS_filter#Star_hack'>star</a> and <a
      href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS_filter#Underscore_hack'>underscore</a>
      hacks. The <a
      href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS_filter#Star_HTML_hack'>star
      HTML</a> hack works fine, as it is valid CSS.</p> <p>Another common hack
      is to use the Microsoft-proprietary <q>zoom:1</q> declaration to trigger
      <em>hasLayout</em>. This will work fine if used with either of the star
      or underscore hacks, but used alone you will get an invalid property
      error. The same goes for any <q>filter</q> or other IE-specific
      declarations (I consider this to be the correct behaviour, as in IE8
      Microsoft have corrected these <a
      href='http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2008/09/08/microsoft-css-vendor-extensions.aspx'>to
      be <q>-ms</q> vendor extensions</a>).</p>
    
    <h2 id='reporting-problems'>Unknown problems</h2>
    <p>If you have any problems with this, you can contact me in one of 
      three ways:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>First, just use the <q>Mark result as containing a problem</q>
        button on the output page to flag the output as something I need to
        examine if you think it is fairly obvious what might be wrong.</li>
      <li>If you think the problem needs a little more explanation, feel 
        free to send me an email describing your problem at
        <a href='mailto:norm@cackhanded.net?subject=CSS Prepare problem'>norm@cackhanded.net</a>. 
        Please include the permanent URL of your problem output in the
        email.</li>
      <li>Or if you prefer, use github to <a 
        href='http://github.com/norm/CSS-Prepare/issues'>report an issue</a>
        with the code. Please include the permanent URL of your problem
        output. (And if you feel up to it, by all means fork it, fix the code
        and send me a pull request.)</li>
    </ol>
